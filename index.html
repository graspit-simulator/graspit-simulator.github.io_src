          GraspIt! was created to serve as a tool for grasping research. It is a simulator that can accommodate arbitrary hand and robot designs originally developed by the <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/robotics/">Columbia University Robotics Group</a>. It can also load objects and obstacles of arbitrary geometry to populate a complete simulation world. The GraspIt! engine includes a rapid collision detection and contact determination system that allows a user to interactively manipulate a robot or an object and create contacts between them. Once a grasp is created, one of the key features of the simulator is the set of grasp quality metrics. Each grasp is evaluated with numeric quality measures, and visualization methods allow the user to see the weak point of the grasp and create arbitrary 3D projections of the 6D grasp wrench space.

          Grasp-Planning: Automatic grasp planning is a difficult problem because of the huge number of possible hand configurations. Humans simplify the problem by choosing an appropriate prehensile posture appropriate for the object and task to be performed. By modeling an object as a set of shape primitives (spheres, cylinders, cones and boxes) we can use a set of rules to generate a set of grasp starting positions and pregrasp shapes that can then be tested on the object model. Each grasp is tested and evaluated, and the best grasps are presented to the user.

          Dynamics: During each time step the system solves for the motion of each body. The constraints are formulated as a linear complementarity problem which can be solved with Lemke's algorithm. Smooth joint trajectories can be created and PD joint controllers apply the necessary torques to carry out a grasp.
